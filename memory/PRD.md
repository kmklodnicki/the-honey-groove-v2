## What's Been Implemented
- Full social feed with cursor-based pagination (BLOCK 184)
- Golden ID paid verification workflow (BLOCK 204, 207)
- Follow Back feature (BLOCK 195)
- Clickable usernames throughout app (BLOCK 202)
- Admin panel polish with user count (BLOCK 200)
- Desktop/Mobile dropdown fixes (BLOCK 197, 215)
- Sub-dollar transaction logic (BLOCK 193)
- Discovery exclusivity fix (BLOCK 188)
- BLOCK 221: Clickable variant pills
- BLOCK 228: Back-to-Top Button
- BLOCK 229: Dream Value Re-Calculator
- BLOCK 231: Snap-Load Shimmer (2-pulse animation, honey-fade-in transitions)
- BLOCK 237: Community Benchmark Logic
- **BLOCK 241: Daily Prompt Shimmer Sync** (March 2026)
  - AlbumArt component: replaced infinite `animate-shimmer` with 2-pulse `honey-shimmer`
  - Image fade-in: 300ms `transition-opacity` on img element (opacity 0 -> 1 when loaded)
  - Glass fallback uses `honey-fade-in` transition
  - Legacy `@keyframes shimmer` in App.css replaced with `honeyShimmer` reference
  - Mobile verified: Daily Prompt card + all album arts have smooth 2-pulse -> fade-in flow
- **BLOCK 242: Live Hive WebSocket Integration** (March 2026)
  - Backend: `live_hive.py` — Socket.IO async server with `emit_new_post()` broadcast
  - Backend: `server.py` — `combined_app` wraps FastAPI with Socket.IO at `/api/ws/socket.io`
  - Backend: All composer endpoints (`now-spinning`, `note`, `new-haul`, `iso`, `randomizer`, `vinyl-mood`) emit `NEW_POST` via `_emit_and_return()`
  - Frontend: `SocketContext.js` — global provider managing Socket.IO connection lifecycle
  - Frontend: `HivePage.js` — listens for `NEW_POST`, queues new posts, shows floating "N new posts" button
  - Author filtering: users don't see their own posts in the notification
  - Live Feed indicator: shows connected/disconnected state with animated honey dot
  - Tested: 100% backend (11/11), frontend visual verification passed
- **BLOCK 243: Valuation Visibility Overhaul** (March 2026)
  - Backend: `POST /valuation/community-value/{discogs_id}` — submit community valuation for any record
  - Backend: `GET /valuation/community-average/{discogs_id}` — get trimmed-mean community average
  - Frontend: `ValuationAssistantModal.js` — full rewrite with `focusItem` prop for single-record valuation mode
  - Frontend: `RecordCard` in CollectionPage — "Value This" amber-bordered button when price is null/0 and record has discogs_id
  - Frontend: TreasuryHeader — amber "⚠️ N records pending valuation" warning under Dream Value
  - Frontend: ProfilePage — matching amber pending link under Dream Value
  - Persistence: saving value instantly updates RecordCard from "Value This" → price badge (no refresh)
  - Data Sync: focus mode shows "Hive Average: $XX.XX" from community trimmed mean
  - Tested: 100% backend (13/13), 100% frontend verification
- **BLOCK 246: Zero-Grey Image Pipeline** (March 2026)
  - Backend: `_generate_blur_data_url()` — generates 10px base64 JPEG from Discogs 150px thumbnails
  - Backend: `cache_discogs_image()` — now also stores `thumb_url` and `blur_data_url` in image_cache
  - Backend: `GET /image/blur-placeholder` — returns cached blur data for any image URL
  - Backend: `POST /image/blur-batch` — batch blur lookup for multiple cover URLs
  - Backend: Prompt responses endpoint enriches with `blur_data_url` and `thumb_url`
  - Frontend: `AlbumArt.js` — accepts `blurDataUrl`, `thumbSrc`, `priority` props; shows blurred placeholder instead of grey shimmer
  - Frontend: `DailyPromptCard` — passes blur data + `fetchpriority="high"` + preload link injection for LCP
  - Frontend: `useBlurPlaceholders` hook — batch-fetches blur data for collection records
  - CSS: `honey-shimmer-overlay` plays over blurred image (not grey)
  - Backfilled 6 existing image_cache entries with blur data
- **BLOCK 247: Collection Completionist Flow** (March 2026)
  - Backend: `GET /valuation/unvalued-queue` — returns records without market/community value
  - Backend: `POST /valuation/wizard-save/{discogs_id}` — saves to community_valuations + collection_values
  - Frontend: `ValuationWizard.js` — full-screen sequential wizard with slide animations
  - TreasuryHeader: "X of Y records valued" + "Add Missing Values" CTA button
  - Wizard UX: one record at a time, large art, Hive Benchmark, currency input
  - Navigation: Save & Next (slide animation), Skip, Done for now
  - Progress bar: "Record X of Y remaining"
  - Celebration state: "Collection Fully Valued! The Hive thanks you."
  - Tested: 100% backend (10/10), 100% frontend verification
